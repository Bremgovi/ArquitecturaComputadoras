# Arquitectura de Computadoras
This is webpage about Computer Architecture Course.
In this webpage we see through every topic related to this course, such as CPU, Memory, I/O, Processing, and much more!


As well as some practices that help us understand the importance of knowing each part of the computer and how is it designed, in this way we are going to be able to manipulate every part of the computer safely.


For the design of this webpage, I used native HTML, CSS and JS, as well as some Javascript libraries such as Particles.js and Fullpage.js for the frontend.
